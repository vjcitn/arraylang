# Introduction

Programming with arrays in R is very natural.  
Arrays in R can be said to be type-polymorphic,
by which we mean that arrays can be defined for different
data types, such as strings, bitfields, double precision numbers.
In this paper we will focus on two-dimensional arrays and
will refer to these as matrices.

A nice property of matrices in R is that we can use different
approaches to element and submatrix extraction.
